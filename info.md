# Visual Studio Code - A Primer

[Visual Studio Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) is a cross-platform text editor built by Microsoft with features to support code development, including [debugging tools](#Debugging), [code completion](#IntelliSense), and syntax highlighting.

The program is built in Electron, a GitHub framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications in JavaScript. GitHub's code editor, [Atom](http://atom.io), is also written in this framework.

This document will serve as a brief overview of some of the key features Visual Studio Code provides as a code editor, with links to the VS Code [documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) for more information.

## The Basics
Visual Studio Code - not to be confused with the Visual Studio IDE - is an open-source text editor written by Microsoft.

When you start up the editor for the first time, you are greeted by the **Welcome** screen:

![Welcome Screen][welcome-screen]

This screen will appear every time you open a new window with the editor as well as every time you close and re-open the application. You can disable this behavior with the checkbox in the lower-left corner of the screen.
